Documentation
-------------

This documentation is generated by `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_.
The `Breathe <https://breathe.readthedocs.io/>`_ extension is used to extract `Doxygen <http://www.doxygen.nl/>`_ documentation from the code and create the API reference.
Also `sphinx-version-warning <https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-version-warning/>`_ to show warnings about not most recent version or if development version when viewing the docs on Read the Docs.
To build these documentation pages, Sphinx, Breathe and Doxygen must be installed.
Doxygen you must install using a package manager or from source.
The dependencies on Sphinx, Breathe and sphinx-version-warning dependencies are specified in :repo-file:`docs/requirements.txt`, which is used by Read the Docs and by the GitHub Actions setup.

We use Read the Docs to build and server the documentation.
Read the Docs is cool because it can serve documentation for several versions of the project.

Tests
-----

We use GitHub Actions.
But we really don't have any good tests. :'(
