message:
  Restructured DEDISbench. All code is documented and the write/read and nominal/peak features were merged into a single process. Added more features for the user to control (benchmark duration, nominal ratio, logging, concurrent processes and file size) and a bash interface. Added documentation for installing and running the benchmark.
